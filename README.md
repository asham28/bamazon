# Bamazon App

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. It can also view and add inventory. 

## Installs 


### MySQL

`npm install mysql`

### Inquirer

`npm install inquirer`

### Console Table

`npm install console.table`


## Getting Started

Run the bamazonCustomer.js to view the store. You will be prompted for the ID and quantity of the item you wish to buy. If there is enough stock, your order will go through and your total price will be displayed. 

Run the bamazonManager.js to manage the Bamazon store. Choose from a list of options that where you can view existing inventory, view only items with a low inventory (less than 5 units) with an option to order more, and add new products.
